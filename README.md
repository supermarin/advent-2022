# Advent of code 2022
https://adventofcode.com/2022

## Readme
For the first time ever I discovered this on time while road tripping.
Wanted to toy with Ruby and Nix & flakes.

## Development
If you would like to try running the examples, you'll need
[Nix](https://nixos.org) installed on your system.

From the project root, execute `nix develop` and Nix will take care of the rest
(installing Ruby, pry, solargraph, etc.).
