# Advent of code 2022

## Readme
For the first time ever I discovered this on time while road tripping.
Wanted to toy with Ruby and Nix & flakes.

## Development
If you would like to try running the examples, you'll need
[Nix](https://nixos.org) installed on your system.

From the project root, execute `nix develop` and Nix will take care of the rest
(installing Ruby, pry, solargraph, etc.).

Each day has it's own .rb file and .txt input (e.g. 1.rb, 1-input.rb), and
contains both solutions for the day. Run with `$ ruby 1.rb` where 1 is the day
you want to run.
